<h3>What's new</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Reintroduce multiple email addresses per category</strong>. Separate multiple email addresses with a comma.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Replace Joomla's keepalive with a custom implementation</strong>. Joomla uses navigator.sendBeacon to implement the Keep-Alive feature. However, some browsers and browser extensions block this feature. As a result your session would expire while filling in the contact form, leading to a 403 error page. We are now using a custom implementation using fetch which is not blocked by browsers and browser extensions.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Bug fixes and minor improvements</strong>. Please take a look at the CHANGELOG below.
