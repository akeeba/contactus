<h3>What's new</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Rewritten with Joomla 4 Core MVC and Bootstrap 5 styling</strong>.
																			 This is a native Joomla 4 extension, written using the core Joomla 4 MVC API and using Bootstrap 5 styling. The database schema management is also core Joomla as are the extension updates and providing the Download Key (Download ID) in the update site. We are no longer using our FOF and FEF frameworks. The package is smaller, the extension is a bit snappier and it all looks and feels very much like the rest of the Joomla backend.
