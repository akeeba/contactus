<h3>What's new?</h3>
<p>
	<strong>New backend and frontend frameworks</strong>.
	This version of our software has been rewritten using the new versions of our FOF (backend) and FEF (frontend) frameworks. The new framework versions load faster, unify our common CSS and JavaScript among all of our extensions, allow us to load all JavaScript defered for better performance and help us provide a much better experience on the upcoming Joomla 4 version.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>View templates are now stored in the tmpl folder instead of ViewTemplates</strong>.
	This change makes it possible to make template overrides for our software in Joomla 4's template manager.
	Existing template overrides are not affected. Template overrides are still stored in the same location
	in your template.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Bug fixes and minor improvements</strong>. Please take a look at the CHANGELOG below.
