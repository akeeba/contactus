<h3>What's new</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Add Show Inline Help support in component options for Joomla 4.1</strong>. <em>This feature adds support for a new Joomla core feature coming in Joomla 4.1.3</em>. The Options page is currently very busy with the long descriptions of every single option. Starting with Joomla 4.1.3 these descriptions will be hidden by default. A button labeled “Show Inline Help” will appear on the site's Toolbar. Clicking on it reveals the descriptions.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Added custom module positions in the contact form</strong>. You can use the new <code>contactus_top</code> and <code>contactus_bottom</code> module positions to further customise the contact form page.
</p>
