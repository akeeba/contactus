# Akeeba Contact Us

A simple contact form component for Joomlaâ„¢

## What does it do?

It lets you add a very simple contact form on your site. Each contact category can have a different set of recipients. Also, each contact category can have an auto-responder. We built this for use on our site. 

## Download

Pre-built packages of Akeeba Release System are made available through [our site's Download page](https://www.akeebabackup.com/download/official/contactus.html).

Akeeba Contact Us comes with English (Great Britain) language built-in. Installation packages for other languages are available [on our language download page](https://cdn.akeebabackup.com/language/contact-us/index.html).

## No support - For developers only

This software is provided **WITHOUT ANY KIND OF SUPPORT WHATSOEVER**. It's also too simple to even have any kind of documentation whatsoever.

If you are a developer you are free to submit a pull request with your code fix, as long as there is a clear description of what was not working for you, why and how you fixed it. 
 
## Prerequisites

In order to build the installation packages of this component you will need to have the following tools:

* A command line environment. Using Bash under Linux / Mac OS X works best. On Windows you will need to run most tools through an elevated privileges (administrator) command prompt on an NTFS filesystem due to the use of symlinks. Press WIN-X and click on "Command Prompt (Admin)" to launch an elevated command prompt.
* A PHP CLI binary in your path
* Command line Git executables
* Phing

You will also need the following path structure inside a folder on your system

* **contactus** This repository
* **buildfiles** [Akeeba Build Tools](https://github.com/akeeba/buildfiles)
* **fof3** [Framework on Framework 3.x](https://github.com/akeeba/fof)
* **fef** [Akeeba FEF](https://github.com/akeeba/fef) (optional, use -Dversion=0.0.0 when building to pull thelatest published version)

You will need to use the exact folder names specified here.

### Useful Phing tasks

All of the following commands are to be run from the MAIN/build directory.
Lines starting with $ indicate a Mac OS X / Linux / other *NIX system commands.
Lines starting with > indicate Windows commands. The starting character ($ or >)
MUST NOT be typed!

#### Creating a dev release installation package

This creates the installable ZIP packages of the component inside the
MAIN/release directory.

    $ phing git
    > phing git
    
**WARNING** Do not distribute the dev releases to your clients. Dev releases, unlike regular releases, also use a
dev version of FOF 3.
